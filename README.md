# SaytsSurfZones
An enormous and ongoing project to zone as many maps as possible for Surftimer-Official, post-285. This is a personal project but I felt it would be worth sharing publically. Due to discrepencies between the tier and zone file it is a little hard to pin down exacts, but there should be about 1170-1190 maps zoned and tiered.

See an incorrect tier? Wrong Maxvelocity? Have you noticed a broken zone while using my tier/zone sql? Please contact me on discord Sayt#0621 or via email and let me know. This is an immense work in progress with multiple phases of completion. A lot of the workshop and miscellaneous maps were tiered based off personal “feel” after surfing and observing each map. Criticism and help in correcting information is always appreciated.

Things to note:

- I still need to manually go back through every map and confirm zones are finalized the way I'd like
- There are a lot of miconfigured hookzones I still need to refix
- There are still missing maps which, if you would be willing to help patch up any missing holes both in zones/tier as well as bsp files that would be appreciated
- You should still personally verify any and all maps you add that are zoned
- This project is what's in stage 1 of about 3 phases.


To use:
If using PHPadmin or some means of dragging and dropping the two sql files then do that, otherwise add them to your database however you normally would add these.

So… why? 
Aren’t a ton of these maps pretty low quality? Isn’t this a lot of work?

Why yes! Yes they are! And yes, yes it is! That’s why I hope you can understand why some maps may have slipped through the cracks or have unfortunate zoning errors at present. The next step will be going back through this new and improved list and confirming/fixing all zones. I deeply enjoy surfing and the community around it. I love nearly all maps if for nothing more than being another new map to check out and surf on. I also happen to love doing large data preservation, archival, and categorization projects! I just never thought to put two and two together and do a large project like this in regards to surf. (Seems kinda obvious now in hindsight.) I find this kinda thing fun and thought it might be useful to someone to have convenient, predefined zones for nearly any map, good, bad, or otherwise. Just drag, drop, and it is good to go. At least that’s the goal of this project. I don’t claim these zones to be perfect, and I am zoning these based off personal preference to a certain extent. 

My zoning methodology has always been edge zoning all platforms with just enough height the player cannot activate their timer with a jump, with all ending platforms zoned as high in the air as possible when appropriate. Unless a map is prohibitively short i.e. single ramp, or it would hinder a usable or non-exploitable skip - all linear maps will be getting checkpoints reasonably placed throughout, just because a map isn't the best quality doesn't mean I don't like seeing my time splits dang it. :v

Anyways, thanks for reading this rambling if you did, I'm unsure what the goal of this project is bessides preserve all the things, zone the world.
