# Project Description
Large and ongoing project to zone more or less all available CSGO Skillsurf maps for Surftimer-Official, post-285. This is a personal project but I felt it would be worth sharing publically. While I have gone through twice now to attempt visually confirming and manually testing that all zones are correct, and working, at this scale please understand maps still fall through the cracks! 


See an incorrect tier? Wrong Maxvelocity? Have you noticed a broken zone while using my tier/zone sql? Please contact me via email and let me know @ sayts.archives@protonmail.com. This is an immense work in progress with multiple phases of completion. A lot of the workshop and miscellaneous maps were tiered based off personal “feel” after surfing and observing each map. Criticism and help in correcting information is always appreciated. If you happen to have a map that works/loads that you do not see listed in my zones here, please contact me.


To use:
If using PHPmyadmin or some means of dragging and dropping the two sql files then do that, otherwise add them to your database however you normally would add these.
