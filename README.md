# SaytsSurfZones
An enormous and ongoing project to zone as many maps as possible for Surftimer-Official, post-285. 


See an incorrect tier? Wrong Maxvelocity? Have you noticed a broken zone while using my tier/zone sql? Please contact me on discord Sayt#0621 or via email and let me know.

Criticism and help in correcting information is always appreciated.

Why yes! Yes it is! And yes, yes they are! That’s why I hope you can understand why some maps may have slipped through the cracks or have unfortunate zoning errors at present. I deeply enjoy surfing and the community around it. I love nearly all maps if for nothing more than being another new map to check out and surf on. I also happen to love doing large data preservation and archival projects! I just never thought to put two and two together and do a large project like this in regards to surf. (Seems kinda obvious now in hindsight.) I find this kinda thing fun and thought it might be useful to someone to have convenient, predefined zones for nearly any map, good, bad, or otherwise. Just drag, drop, and it is good to go. At least that’s the goal of this project. I don’t claim these zones to be perfect, and I am zoning these based off personal preference to a certain extent. My zoning methodology has always been edge zoning all platforms with just enough height the player cannot activate their timer with a jump, with all ending platforms zoned as high in the air as possible when appropriate.
